# Tobias Gray's blog

This repo will serve as both my blog, and a public repository of my publically shared works.

My name is Tobias Gray! I am avid reader, writer, and editor of many different genres, including but not limited to: Sci-fi, fantasy, horror, and speculative fiction. You'll find all of that and more here!

I chose to use this simple approach instead of mucking around with software, databases, or coding. 

Check back frequently!
